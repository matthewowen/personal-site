In the light of the new [PECR rules](http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/current_topics/new_pecr_rules.aspx) on cookies and explicit opt-in, I've been thinking a lot about Google Analytics. Working with a number of clients in the charitable/not-for-profit space, meeting regulations on privacy is a big concern - it is important to take seriously the possible implications of the cookies that Google Analytics sets.

But really, it's really raised the question to me of what we use Google Analytics for. As a tool, it makes it super simple to collect visitor data. This is, in principle, a Good Thing. But it also makes it too easy.

It's basic good sense that collecting data on how your site performs with users is valuable. But the difficult part is figuring out what data is a meaningful indicator of that. Unless your website is an advertising based business, there's a strong likelihood that time on site and pageviews per visit aren't meaningful quality metrics. Of course, that isn't all you can get out of Google Analytics, but it is the data which is placed front and centre - so it is a natural focus of attention. The ease of setting it up and accessing it makes it easy to avoid the difficult questions: what does success look like, and how do we measure that?

For web based businesses, this question can be difficult enough (if only because at the very least it requires us to weigh long term and short term aims against each other). For a predominantly offline organisation trying to pave their way online, it is a fundamental question that's often skipped over.

This isn't to say you shouldn't use Google Analytics. You probably should. But the first question to answer when you look at your data shouldn't be 'how are we doing?'. It should be 'how do we know how we are doing?'. The answer probably isn't 'more pageviews per visit'.
