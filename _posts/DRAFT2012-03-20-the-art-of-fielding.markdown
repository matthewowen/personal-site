Last weekend (at ATP and on the way home) I read Chad Harbach's recent(ish) novel, [The Art of Fielding](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Fielding-Chad-Harbach/dp/0007374445). I enjoyed it, clearly (I read it within two days). It's an easy novel to consume; the plot tumbles along, and although the prose is oddly clunky in places it reads pretty well on the whole.

But there are lots of easy novels to consume that don't get a lot of attention. The Art of Fielding has had a lot of attention, presumably because of its apparent aspirations to be a Novel (capital 'N'). I can't criticise this too strongly, because my overwhelming desire whilst reading it was to write something about it, and the way writing becomes Literature is because people feel compelled to write about it.

If you aren't familiar, the novel's essentially a coming of age novel centred around a few college baseball players. It's easy to see how this works, because baseball is the perfect vehicle for the coming of age plot. 

A common trope is that baseball is about failure. A really great batter has an on base percentage around .400 (if you noticed that .400 isn' a percentage, congratulations on being a pedant) - this means that 60% of the time they come up to bat, they make an out. They fail. This isn't really true though, unless you only look at hitting. A really great pitcher having a great season has a WHIP of around 1.0 - on average, they allow one person per inning (each inning has three outs) to not make an out. The 'best defensive team ever' (in quotes because defensive statistics suck) where the 2007 Colorado Rockies, with a fielding percentage of .98925. This means that of all the opportunities their players had to make an out by catching or throwing a player our, they did it successfully 98.925% of the time. This is quite often, and quite relevant to this novel.

No, what baseball is really about is fractions. A great player has an on base percentage around .400, but below .350 is pretty dicey, and below .300 is pretty terrible. A player can expect to come up to bat around four times in a game. The difference between a great player and a not very good player, therefore, is about one out every five games.

It's a little easier to see with pitchers - if you have a WHIP over 1.5, you won't be long for the majors. But again, compared to a great player, this is just one more player not making an out every two innings. For fielding (notwithstanding that errors don't mean much) a few great players might have error free seasons, and a few terrible players might have 20 or so errors a season, but by and large, over a 162 game season, the variance is about 10 errors. This isn't many.
