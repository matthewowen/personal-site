As you may be aware, there's [a bit shitstorm going on at Reddit](http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web). Predictably, many Redditors are up in arms about the 'doxxing' of violentacrez.

I find this to be a remarkable bit of cognitive dissonance. Let's be clear - if you condone putting sexualised images of unconsenting people on the internet, you can have no expectation to not be doxxed. Putting this content out has [real world ramifications](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2010/may/11/pcc-privacy). The exact same arguments that are made for why this content is acceptable (either that "people can't have an expectation of privacy in a public place" or that "if you can find it on the internet, it is your fault for letting it get on the internet") can be made for doxxing being acceptable (if you want to hide your identity, you shouldn't have made it possible for people to identify you).

More than that, it is perfectly valid to support the doxxing of people like violentacrez whilst also rejecting the kind of content that was posted to /r/creepshots. If you do not believe other people have a right to this privacy, then you are not entitled to that right of privacy yourself.

However, there's a wider point here about anonymity on the internet. As a community, Reddit is defined by it's lack of admin oversight. Largely, social norms are built by consensus. Unfortunately, that consensus seems to be dominated by a particular subset of users, whose social norms are somewhat skewed (as evidenced by the casual racism and sexism that litters the site). But once your online presence is inextricably linked to your 'IRL' presence, those Reddit norms become irrelevant, because they become overruled by the wider social norms of society.

I've ummed and ahhed over this, but I think it's a good thing. I don't think it will kill Reddit (despite what a certain subset of Redditors might think), because fundamentally the majority of content on Reddit is not the sort of thing one would be ashamed be associated with. In fact, I think it's likely to make Reddit a better place. If you expect your comments to be linked to you in real life, perhaps you'll think twice about making a leery comment about a woman who has had the audacity post a picture in which she appears. And, once you introduce those wider social norms, people will be a lot less wary of contributing to subreddits like r/creepshots, r/jailbait, and r/picsofdeadkids. I don't know if it'd wipe them out, but it'd be nice if it did.

I think there's something positive about anonymous internet consumption, and I see where there are benefits to being able to post content anonymously. But on Reddit, too often anonymity is desired so that users feel free to post offensive comments that they don't want to be associated with personally. I don't believe that's a positive thing for Reddit or for wider society, and I'm more and more of the opinion that if you're building an online community, anonymity should be considered harmful.
