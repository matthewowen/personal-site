I have little hard basis for this claim, but based on the fact that I've recently read both _The Marriage Plot_ (Eugenides) and _The Art of Fielding_ (Harbach) I've decided that the university centered 'coming of age novel' is a "thing".

I think this is endlessly fascinating, because it strikes me that students currently approaching graduation are probably 'coming of age' less than almost any other generation of college students.

When I was approaching the end of my university 'career', my peers were too busy wrestling with the same stress over finding a job that they'd been contending with for the past year. For many, that stress was intensified by the multiple summers dedicated to to internships taken with the intention of smoothing the post-graduation job-hunt.

We didn't have time to feel like we were coming of age. We'd been career hunting for years. Maybe a privileged few went to Indiahhh [sic] and 'found themselves'. Most of us were at least pretending to have found ourselves already, and trying to make what we'd found seem employable.
