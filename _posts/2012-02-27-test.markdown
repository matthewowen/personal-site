Check, *check*.

I read [this blogpost](http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/500-words-before-8am) about starting the day as a producer and a consumer, and it clicked. I don't mean in every literal sense - I'd like to get up earlier, but baby steps here, I think - but rather in a wider, broader way.

I'm not alone or exceptional in my online consumption. I probably read Reddit and Hacker News every day. I spend plenty of time on Twitter. My RSS reader contains far more subscriptions than I could ever hope to deal with.

I feel a weight of content debt - a deficit, if you will. The assumption, of course, is that one can redress that balance somewhat by raising a voice in return, by also speaking into the great void of online media. I'm not fully convinced that this is the case in any sense that matters to anyone but the producer, but this ought not to and does not diminish my enjoyment. To write is to think, and the chance to reflect as well as consume can only be a good thing.

I'm not yet sure what I'll be focusing on. Most of my time has lately been spent on 'the web' - especially Python and mobile. But I would be surprised if I didn't post much more widely - literature, current events, 'the weather'.

Hopefully some people will join me for the ride...
