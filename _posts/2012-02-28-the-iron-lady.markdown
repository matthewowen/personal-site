title: The (right honourable) Iron Lady
---

I watched [The Iron Lady](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007029/) this past weekend.

My feelings are mixed. I'm not a Thatcher fan, obviously. But it is odd and callous to make a film which focuses so heavily and so grotesquely on her Alzheimer's (and, more so, which speculates on the nature and manifestations of that Alzheimer's). It seems to me to be emotion-by-numbers. Affecting, yes - but surely biopics ought to make one feel emotion towards the 'real' people they are 'about'. Though I feel sympathy towards the fictional Thatcher of the film, I feel no more sympathy to the 'real' Thatcher than I did last week - precisely because the emotional heart of the film seems so plainly bolted on, conjured from the depths of Abi Morgan's imagination.

Of course, a flaw that one might pick with this criticism is that the real and the fictional Thatchers are both (for all intents and purposes) media constructs - one from the branch of media that calls its work fictional, one from the branch that calls its work factual.

However, that doesn't negate the central crux of it - the 'real' Thatcher's status as a media construct does not make her any less real - a film which deals with a factual figure ought to engage with the factual construct if it is to be anything other than an irrelevant aside. We can go on about constructs until the cows come home, but we'll still be calling it a home - everything's a construct somehow. It doesn't mean we should go around disregarding constructs willy-nilly. 

But in any case, the original point I meant to make was that my hackles were raised by the uncensured use of 'you' in a section of Commons debate. As any regular listener to [Today in Parliament](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtqd) will tell you, politicians are **never** to refer to one another as 'you' - always as 'right honourable gentleman/-woman/friend' - because all questions and answers are, of course, addressed to the speaker. It seems an awful shame to omit such details - particularly as the film deals with a figure whose rise was so improbable in the context of her party and the parliament.

In summary: pretty enjoyable if you watch it as an Abi Morgan film loosely based on Margaret Thatcher. But if you're hoping for a film that engages with the 'real' Thatcher, you're probably out of luck. Morgan doesn't let what's 'real' get in the way of a good line (or a good story).
