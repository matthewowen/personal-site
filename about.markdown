## About Matthew Owen ##

Hi there.

My name's Matthew Owen. I work at [Torchbox](http://www.torchbox.com "Torchbox") as a project manager with clients such as WWF, Yahoo!, ActionAid, and Oxfam. My work involves site builds and support in Drupal and Django, as well as digital marketing campaigns.

Outside of work, I've developed [Oxbus](http://www.oxbus.co.uk "Live Oxfordshire bus times") and [londonb.us](http://londonb.us "Live London bus times"): mobile sites designed to make it as easy as possible to get live bus times in Oxfordshire and London respectively.

More generally, I'm interested in Python, the mobile web, and the potential for the web (and especially the movile web) to make interactions with physical services easier.

Before all of this, I studied Classics and English at the [University of Oxford](http://ox.ac.uk) (St Hugh's College).
