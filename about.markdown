## About Matthew Owen ##

Hi there.

My name's Matthew Owen. I work at [Torchbox](http://www.torchbox.com "Torchbox") as a project manager with clients such as WWF, Yahoo!, ActionAid, and Oxfam. My work involves site builds and support in Drupal and Django, as well as digital marketing campaigns.

Outside of work, I've developed [SFTransit](http://www.sftransit.us/ "Live transit times for San Francisco and the Bay Area"), [Oxbus](http://www.oxbus.co.uk "Live Oxfordshire bus times") and [LondonGo](http://www.londongo.net "Live London bus and tube times"): sites designed to make it as quick and easy as possible to get live transit times on your mobile phone.

More generally, I'm interested in Python, JavaScript, the mobile web, and the potential for the web (and especially the mobile web) to make interactions with physical services easier.

Lately, I've been hacking about making plugins for the popular 'blog aware static site generator' [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). It is making me like Ruby, which is nice.

Before all of this, I studied Classics and English at the [University of Oxford](http://ox.ac.uk) (St Hugh's College).
